# Himalayan Carbon Labs

A satellite-based MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) dashboard designed to help Uttarakhand's farmers and Van Panchayats generate and sell carbon credits. 

We built this during Hacktoberfest to solve a real problem: measuring forest biomass is expensive, but our open-source stack makes it accessible for rural communities.

##  Hacktoberfest 2026 - Prize Categories
We specifically built and deployed this project to align with the hackathon tracks:
*   **Best Open-Source AI Project (DigitalOcean):** Hosted on DigitalOcean App Platform using open-weights AI.
*   **Best Use of Gemma 4:** Integrated Google's lightweight Gemma 4 model via the Gemini API to create a localized AI assistant for farmers.

##  What's inside?

*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of mapped area, estimated credits, and revenue.
*   **GIS Map Integration:** Leaflet.js map showing the pilot area boundaries in Uttarkashi.
*   **Carbon Estimator:** A quick tool to calculate potential credits based on land area (Max 10,000 Ha).
*   **AI Chat Assistant (Gemma 4):** A localized assistant that helps farmers understand carbon credit calculations and MRV processes in simple terms.
*   **PDF Export:** One-click report generation for sharing data with stakeholders.

##  How we used Gemma 4 & DigitalOcean

### 1. The AI Assistant (Gemma 4)
Carbon market jargon is confusing for local farmers. We integrated **Gemma 4** using the Gemini API. Instead of reading complex PDFs, farmers can ask questions directly on the dashboard like:
*   *"Mere 2 hectare apple bagiche se kitna credit banega?"*
*   *"Mujhe carbon credit bechne ke liye kya documents chahiye?"*
Gemma 4 processes this and replies in a simple, localized format. We chose Gemma 4 because its lightweight architecture gives us fast inference times without burning a hole in our API budget.

### 2. The Infrastructure (DigitalOcean)
We used **DigitalOcean** to host our entire stack. 
*   **App Platform:** Used to deploy our frontend dashboard directly from this GitHub repo.
*   **Spaces (Object Storage):** Used to store the generated PDF reports and satellite image crops securely, ensuring we don't bloat the main server.
*   **Droplets:** Running a lightweight backend container to handle API requests between the frontend and the Gemini API.
